# openCV Projects
Computer Vision based projects using openCV

1) bg_remove_basic: Rudimentary prototype for background removal tool (in webcam feed) using masking techniques.
2) bg_remove_mp: Background removal tool using mediapipe library.
3) face_detection: Detects faces in videos or webcam feed, draws a bounding box and shows detection confidence.
4) face_mesh: Detects faces in video/webcam feed and plots a tesselated mesh on the face. Useful for AR filters (eg: snapchat filters)
5) finger_based_volume_control: Control device volume using index finger and thumb (webcam required). 
                                Note: Code is written for macOS, but is easily modifiable for windows as well.
