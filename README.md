# openCV Projects
Computer Vision based projects using openCV

1) [bg_remove_basic](https://github.com/Gau17/openCV/blob/main/bg_remove_basic): Rudimentary prototype for background removal tool (in webcam feed) using masking techniques.
2) [bg_remove_mp](https://github.com/Gau17/openCV/blob/main/bg_remove_mp): Background removal tool using mediapipe library.
3) [face_detection](https://github.com/Gau17/openCV/blob/main/face_detection): Detects faces in videos or webcam feed, draws a bounding box and shows detection confidence.
4) [face_mesh](https://github.com/Gau17/openCV/blob/main/face_mesh): Detects faces in video/webcam feed and plots a tesselated mesh on the face. Useful for AR filters (eg: snapchat filters)
6) [finger_gesture_based_vol_control](https://github.com/Gau17/Finger_based_vol_control): Control device volume using index finger and thumb (webcam required). Note: Code is written for macOS, but is easily modifiable for windows as well.
